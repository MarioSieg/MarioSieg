## About Me: Unleashing the Power of Technology 💥🚀

I am a passionate software engineer, fearless hacker, and ingenious electro tinkerer, driven by an insatiable curiosity for unraveling the inner workings of technology. At 21 years old, I come from Germany 🇩🇪, and my boundless enthusiasm fuels my journey of exploration and innovation.

## Programming Pioneer 💻🌟
I embarked on my programming odyssey at the tender age of 13, captivated by the world of game development and the potential of C# and Unity. Since then, my focus has evolved, delving into the realms of low-level systems programming, conquering challenges in C, C++, and Assembly. From crafting intricate x86 bootloaders to optimizing matrix multiplication with AVX SIMD intrinsics in Vulkan game engines, and even crafting polymorphic JIT compilers, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of software craftsmanship.

## A Curious Mind 🧠💡
Research is my playground, and my interests span a wide spectrum of domains. From exploring the intricacies of programming languages and the art of compiler design (both AOT and JIT) to unraveling the secrets of machine languages and intermediate representations, I continuously seek to deepen my understanding. The realms of game engines, robotics, animatronics, and graphics programming ignite my imagination, driving me to uncover new possibilities and shape the future.

## Inspiring Presentations 🎤🌟
Sharing knowledge and inspiring fellow enthusiasts is an integral part of my journey. Through captivating presentations delivered in both German and English, I have had the privilege of enlightening audiences on diverse topics. From Vulkan game engine development and the nuances of x86-64 assembly to the realm of modern C++, I have left my mark as a knowledgeable and engaging presenter.

## Tools of the Trade ⚒️🔧
In my arsenal, you'll find an array of beloved programming languages and tools. From the elegant simplicity of C, C++, and Lua to the versatility of C#, Rust, Java, and Python, I harness the right tool for every job. Linux serves as my trusted companion, accompanied by powerful allies such as gcc, git, objdump, IDA, CLion, and VSCode, enabling me to wield technology with precision and finesse.

## Hardware Enthusiast 🖥️💡
I revel in the realm of hardware, leveraging cutting-edge devices to bring my visions to life. From my primary workstation, featuring the mighty AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970x with 32 cores and 64 threads, to the Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM, serving as my IOT and AArch64-target device, and the trusty old Dual-Xeon HP Z600 Workstation as my test system, I embrace the power and versatility of the hardware landscape. Additionally, a formidable AMD Opteron Rack with four 16-core CPUs and 64GB RAM fuels my server endeavors.

## Unleashing the Future 🌌🚀
Armed with an unwavering passion and an unyielding spirit, I forge ahead, shaping the future of technology through my code, creations, and collaborations. With Linux Mint and Ubuntu Server as my allies, I navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape, exploring uncharted territories, and leaving an indelible mark on the world of software engineering.

*Let's embark on this incredible journey together, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and unlocking the true potential of technology.* 🔥✨🚀
