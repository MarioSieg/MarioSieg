## Mario "Neo" Sieg

Since my youngest days I am very curious and interested in how things really work. Disassembling TVs, Radios and building electronical devices with their parts was my primary interest when I was a child. 
At 13 I discovered game development with Unity and C#.
At 14  I released my first commercial game on Steam: "Nukklerma Robot Warfare".

After my first commercial success, I dived into game engine development and graphics programming with C++, Lua and multiple graphics APIs such as Direct3D11, 12 and Vulkan.
I spent the next years writing different game engines and simulation systems.

To simplify the development process of complex games within my own engines, I took another deep dive on compilers and interpreters, focusing on JIT (Just In Time) compilation for statically typed languages on x86-64 aswell as efficient implementations of virtual machines.
This resulted in my research programming-lanuage "Neo".
I also won the second price at Jugend-Forscht, a German science competition with a custom language-runtime.

In 2023 I moved to Berlin to study and to refine my technical knowledge and skills even more.
Today, my primary interesents are:

* Game (engine) development
* GPU programming
* Machine learning
* Virtual machines and compilers
* Programming language design
* Dynamic code generation and optimization
* C and C++ programming
* Rust and Lua programming
* Mathematics
* Operating system kernels
* Electronics and robotics
