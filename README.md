## 🔥 Mario "Neo" Sieg 🔥

### 🚀 About Me 🚀

My name is Mario alias "Neo" and technology has always been my primary interest. 💻  
From a young age, I've been driven by an insatiable curiosity to understand how things work. 🔍  
My journey into the world of programming began at the age of 13 when I stumbled upon a video about game development, and I instantly knew that I had found my passion. 🎮  

Today, I immerse myself in the captivating realm of low-level systems programming, where I harness the power of C, C++, and Assembly.  
I craft elegant solutions, from crafting a long mode bootloader in x86-{16,32,64} assembly to optimizing matrix multiplication using AVX SIMD intrinsics in a cutting-edge Vulkan game engine.  
But my endeavors don't stop there; I've even ventured into the realm of building a polymorphic JIT compiler, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. 💡
