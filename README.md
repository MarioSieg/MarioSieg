<h2>Mario "Neo" Sieg</h2>

<h3> About me </h3>

Computers are a component of my whole life.<br>
Since I was a child I was never pleasured by using something without knowing how it works.<br>
I started programming when I was 13 years old in C# using Unity when I saw a video about game-development.<br>
<br>
Today my focus lies in low level systems programming using C, C and Assembly.<br>
Writing a long mode bootloader in x86-{16,32,64} assembly,<br>
optimizing matrix multiplication using AVX SIMD intrinsics in a Vulkan game engine and writing a polymorphic JIT compiler are examples of things I do.<br>
Programming made it possible to dive into software and build my own technology by just using my mind and a text editor.<br>
